# Windsurf Rules for Product Management Application

## Project Structure
- This is a Flask-based product management application
- Main application code is in `src/main/python/`

## Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibility

## Development Practices
- Always run tests before committing changes
- Use virtual environment for dependency management

- Follow semantic versioning for releases

## File Naming Conventions
- Python files: snake_case.py
- HTML templates: kebab-case.html
- CSS files: kebab-case.css
- JavaScript files: camelCase.js

## Database

- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Testing
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Use pytest for testing framework
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Mock external dependencies in tests

## Documentation
